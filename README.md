# Integrating data at multiple spatial scales to estimate the local burden of the opioid syndemic

In this project we estimate one latent factor characterizing variation of the syndemic across space in Ohio. There are 5 different outcomes considered in this project: 
- Death counts: county-level counts; included are the counts of unintentional overdose deaths involving illicit opioids.
- Treatment counts: county-level counts; included are the number of uninsured individuals and Medicaid beneficiaries with opioid use disorder served by treatment programs.
- HCV infections: county-level counts; included acute and chronic cases of HCV cases.
- HIV infections: county-level counts; included are newly diagnosed HIV infections.
- Naloxone counts: ZIP code level counts.
